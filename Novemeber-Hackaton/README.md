## Solution
In our App the user will be able to view upcoming events based off of categories ie Sports, Music etc but the user will also be able to filter for a specific event based off of a location.
The user can also select a certain event and view all the information of that event:
- Name of the event
- Date of the event
- Location of the event
- Cost of the event / Entrance fee
- Additional information about the event
- Weather forecast for the day
- Map with pinned location of the event

## Who
### Persona 1:
Cheryl the food truck owner
### Persona 2:
Skye the event dancer
### Persona 3:
Gideon the party attendee

## What Information/Data:
A user will be able to view all upcoming events in a location and see all detail about those events.

## How does it support your Personas:
Our personas will be able to go to one App to view all information needed about an event - the weather, date, location etc
With this data our personas will have all the information at their fingertips and will be able to decide on what events to attend accordingly.
